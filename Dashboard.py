    ## Aims

    - Apply knowledge gained from the DSHI course on a practical scenario related to a medical task.
    - Build a web dashboard incorporating data science techniques to solve problems relevant to the selected medical dataset.
    - Understand how user testing helps to iteratively improve technical systems for data science.

    ## Deliverables
    1. Web medical dashboard [6 points]
    2. Final project report [10 points]
    3. Portfolio showcasing video [1 point]
    4. Final presentation with slides [3 points]

"""
The final project aims to apply data science concepts and skills on a 
medical case study that you and your team select from a public data source.
The project assumes that you bring the technical Python skills from 
previous courses (*DSHI*: Data Science for Health Informatics), as well as 
the analytical skills to argue how and why specific techniques could
enhance the problem domain related to the selected dataset.
